# BLE-Mesh
An BLE based mesh netowork platform for android

folk from https://github.com/OnlyInAmerica/BLEMeshChat/tree
BLEMeshChat don't support multi hop well.
each device only connect to around every other devices to from a mesh net.
which don't support goal directed connection.

This project hope to realize that device can form a multi hop net, and choose specific remote device which is reachable by one hop or multi hops.
and then communicate with that device.
